// This file contains types that are used both by the API and internally
// to Tesseract. In order to decouple the API from Tesseract and prevent cyclic
// dependencies, THIS FILE SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON ANY OTHER PART OF TESSERACT.
// Restated: It is OK for low-level Tesseract files to include publictypes.h,
// but not for the low-level tesseract code to include top-level API code.
// This file should not use other Tesseract types, as that would drag
// their includes into the API-level.
// API-level code should include apitypes.h in preference to this file.
