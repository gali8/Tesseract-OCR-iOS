/*
 *  bbuffer.h
 *
 *      Expandable byte buffer for reading data in from memory and
 *      writing data out to other memory.
 *
 *      This implements a queue of bytes, so data read in is put
 *      on the "back" of the queue (i.e., the end of the byte array)
 *      and data written out is taken from the "front" of the queue
 *      (i.e., from an index marker "nwritten" that is initially set at
 *      the beginning of the array.)  As usual with expandable
 *      arrays, we keep the size of the allocated array and the
 *      number of bytes that have been read into the array.
 *
 *      For implementation details, see bbuffer.c.
