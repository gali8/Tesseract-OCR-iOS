Tesseract Lib for iOS
=====================


About
-----

This project contains only the [leptonica](http://www.leptonica.com/download.html) and [tesseract-ocr](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) libraries compiled for iOS.

There is no support for armv6, so it won't work with iPhone 1st Gen and iPhone 3G.


Usage
-----

You might want to use this [tesseract-ios](https://github.com/ldiqual/tesseract-ios) to include Tesseract in your iOS project. For a more advanced usage, you can use the raw library with regular C++ code.

Don't forget to rename your implementation classes with `.mm` instead of `.m` as it uses C++ code.
